## [TCP RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793)

There appears to be some communication that only one side sees, negotiating ports and delivery methods etc. This may be difficult to express as a session type.

The three-way-handshake can be written as the following session types:
`? Int . ! (Int, Int) . ? Int . T` and `! Int . ? (Int, Int) . ! Int . S`, where `T` and `S` are the rest of the connection. This is the normal case, it is possible for more data to be sent and for no sequence to be followed.

Normal data flow across TCP happens by simply sending data packets in particular formats. It is not worth expressing it as a Session Type, it could instead be a medium that Session Types communicate across.

## [RAML](https://raml.org/developers/raml-100-tutorial)

It seems RESTful APIs are not suited to being expressed as a Session Type, since they are simply a request/response over HTTP. RAML is a good way to specify what a RESTful API does, Session Types are unnecessary here.

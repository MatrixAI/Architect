## [Gradual Session Types](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/gradsess/gradsess.pdf)

This paper refers to `&{...}` as case and `+{...}` as select, rather than offer and choose, and it referse to end! as close rather than kill. The session types used in constructing larger session types are referred to as residuals.

## Covariance and Contravariance

All session types are covariant in their residuals, so `a <: b` and `c <: d` imply
* `! t . a <: ! t . b`
* `? t . a <: ? t . b`
* `+{k:a, l:c} <: +{k:b, l:d}`
* `&{k:a, l:c} <: &{k:b, l:d}`

Duality is contravariant, so `a <: b` implies `dual b <: dual a`

The only interesting case is when a choose/offer is a subset/superset:
* `+{k:a} <: +{k:a, l:b}`
* `&{k:a, l:b} <: &{k:a}`

# Compiler Infrastructure

Progress notes on https://github.com/MatrixAI/Architect/issues/14

Created the Core directory. This should represent the language core for now.

Core is sometimes the core libraries.

One could also call it base.

We also have parser, and lexer.

These things will need to be considered as well.

Actually changed to compiler library.

We have brought in the hint library.

---

First we need to learn megaparsec and do some examples of parsing the language.

Then we will check out the hint library and see what we can do.

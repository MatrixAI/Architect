## Comparing fixpoints

According to [this paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=E9553A8E474735123318F0A81ED7F185?doi=10.1.1.4.2276&rep=rep1&type=pdf) it is possible to write all types containing a mu in a unique way. If this is the case, it would be possible to express any session type uniquely, and thus easily compare any two session types. I cannot understand how they have determined this unique representation. The notation and terminology are confusing.

What about subtyping though. At the moment, checking subtypes of fixed points is done by assuming the bound variables satisfy the subtype relation and checking if that makes the contents satisfy it. However, if we are aiming for a more complete (lenient) comparison, we might have to do more complicated comparisons. For example, `µt. &{a: !Bool; &{b:end}, b:end}` should be a suptype of `µt. &{a: !Bool; t, b: end}`.

Haskell uses isorecursive types, these are easy to work with and compare. If we can have equirecursive types that would be great, but I do not believe this is possible with subtyping.

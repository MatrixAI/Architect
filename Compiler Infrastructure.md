# Compiler Infrastructure

Progress notes on https://github.com/MatrixAI/Architect/issues/14

Created the Core directory. This should represent the language core for now.

Core is sometimes the core libraries.

One could also call it base.

We also have parser, and lexer.

These things will need to be considered as well.

Actually changed to compiler library.

We have brought in the hint library.

Typechecking is easiest achieved with bidirectional type checking. As this supports both inference and type checking.

The introduction: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bidirectional+typechecking

Implementation in Haskell: https://github.com/ollef/Bidirectional (see the papers)

Also we are implementing this via http://semantic-domain.blogspot.com/2012/12/total-functional-programming-in-partial.html

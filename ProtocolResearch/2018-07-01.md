## Recursive Types

Haskell's `Fix` type constructor only works when defined as a `newtype` or `data`, and it is impossible to construct a recursive type any other way (using `type` won't work), which means all cycles are explicit: the only type equal to `Fix F` is `Fix F`, there is no way to make something like `F (Fix F)` that is equal to `Fix F`.

It seems odd, but `Fix F = Fix F` is true regardless of the definitions of `Fix` or `F`, and both `Fix_ F = Fix F` and `Fix G = Fix F` are false regardless of the definitions of these types, once all `type` synonyms have been evaluated.

So simply put, type synonyms cannot be cyclic and are fully evaluated, but data and newtype constructors are equal iff they were defined to be equal.

Can a type feature two fix points? The HTTP session type might need that, unless we allow for concatenation of session types.

### [Recursive Subtypes](http://lucacardelli.name/papers/srt.pdf)

This is apparently correct: `(s<:t implies a<:b) implies µs.a <: µt.b`. Checking that `s<:t implies a<:b` is not trivial without fixpoints being explicitly represented (since `µs.[s] == µt.[[t]]`), but with a unique representation of fixpoints this can be checked, though the code will be complicated.

## Thoughts

I wonder if it's easy to check if a regular language is a subset of another regular language by comparing minimal DFAs.

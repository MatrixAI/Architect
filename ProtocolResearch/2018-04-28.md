## Gradual Session Types revisited

Which in each pair is a subtype of the other?

* `&{a:b}` or `&{a:b,c:d}`
* `+{a:b}` or `+{a:b,c:d}`

It is somewhat tempting to say the smaller one is always more general, it has fewer properties, and so that larger one is the subtype. However, the application of subtypes in session types is that if two session types `A` and `B` are compatible, and `A` and `B` are subtypes of `A'` and `B'` respectively, then `A'` and `B'` should be compatible.

This is reflected in http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/gradsess/gradsess.pdf, where on page 38:9 it is stated that `+{a:b,c:d}` would be the subtype of `+{a:b}`, and `&{a:b}` is the subtype of `&{a:b,c:d}`.
